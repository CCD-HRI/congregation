# congregation
Relational query compiler for MPC based on the [conclave](https://github.com/multiparty/conclave) system.

This system requires python >=3.8. It's recommended that you
use a virtualenv when working with it, as it makes sys calls to 
python for local computations, and those calls need to resolve 
to the correct version.
