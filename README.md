# congregation
Relational query compiler for MPC based on the [conclave](https://github.com/multiparty/conclave) system.

## install

This system requires python >=3.8. It's recommended that you
use a virtualenv when working with it, as it makes calls to 
python throughout and those calls need to resolve to the correct
version.
