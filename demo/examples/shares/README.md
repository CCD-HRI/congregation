# example workflows with pre-shared data

The example files in this directory assume an identical input setup to those in \
the `demo/shares/` directory. Accordingly, it assumes that there are three input \
parties, each with a 3 column dataset consisting of secret shared integers. For a \
concrete example, reference the files located at `demo/shares/party_one/inpt.csv`, \
`demo/shares/party_two/inpt.csv`, and `demo/shares/party_three/inpt.csv`.
