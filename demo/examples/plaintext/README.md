# plaintext example workflows

The example files in this directory assume an identical input setup to those in \
the `demo/plaintext/` directory. Accordingly, it assumes that there are three input \
parties, each with a 3 column dataset consisting of integers. For a concrete example, \
reference the files located at `demo/plaintext/party_one/in1.csv`, `demo/plaintext/party_two/in2.csv`,
and `demo/plaintext/party_three/in3.csv`.
